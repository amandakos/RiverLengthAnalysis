# RiverLengthAnalysis
A quick analysis of the "rivers" vector of river lengths in R.
Using the built in "rivers" vector, a data frame is created to look at the distribution of the data.
A histogram checks for normal distribution, as does a Q-Q plot.
Normal distribution is not shown.
Additionally, a boxplot was created to check for outliers visually.
A statistical check also accompanies the graph.
